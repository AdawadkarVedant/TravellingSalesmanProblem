*** Project Title ***
- Travelling Salesman Problem Using Nature Inspired Computation

*** Description ***
- A project coursework as part of the assessment for Nature Inspired Computation module (ECMM409) for MSc. Data Science. 
- The project is a take on solving the travelling salesman problem using Genetic Algorithms with combinations of various parameters and experiments.

*** Getting Started ***
*** Dependencies ***
- In order to successfully execute the program, please make sure to install the following python packages through the python terminal or through an IDE:

- Numpy - pip install numpy
- Pandas - pip install pandas
- Matplotlib - pip install matplotlib
- BeautifulSoup - pip install bs4
- LXML - pip install lxml
- Seaborn - pip install seaborn

*** How to run ***
- Once the packages are installed, you can simply execute the program from your preffered IDE. On successful execution of the program, you should see an exit code 0 message in the console.
NOTE: In case of VSCode IDE, you need to check the option 'Execute in File Dir' available in File->Preferences->Settings->Extensions->Python.
NOTE: In case of PyCharm IDE, you may need to setup a virtual enviornment and add the required packages for the program to run successfully.

*** After running the program ***
- Upon successfully running the program, the program will create 2 directories burma14 and brazil58.
- Each directory will have Fitness_Score.csv that contains an overview of the all experiments that have been carried out.
- The directory will also 3 images - CountryName_best_fitness, CountryName_worst_fitness and CountryName_execution_time - that contains a heat map of all experiments which has been derived from the Fitness_Score.csv.
- The program will also create another within the country directories called Iterations.
- Iterations directory will have a file called Iteration_Fitness.csv that consists detailed information regarding all the experiments that have been carried out.
